TAD (Thermodynamic Analysis of DNA). Programm for design and Tm analysis oligo DNA by NNearest Neighbor Thermodynamic Parameters. 
The program allows you to analyze DNA molecules to determine the thermodynamic profile, the formation of homo- and hetero- dimers.

The program structure and code can be viewed in the .py files.
Gui.py, tool_bar.py contains the code for the graphical shell of the TAD program.
tm_oligo.py contain contains the code for mathematical calculations of the thermodynamic profile, and analysis of dimers

You can put the compiled code in exe. file [TAD(KeyGeneArt).exe] and run the program immediately for use.
